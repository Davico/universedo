We have adopted these Privacy Rules, which determine the way in which we process information collected through Universedo, and the reasons for which we must collect certain personal data about you.

                <h2>3. Why do we process your data?</h2>
                <p>
                    Our top priority is the security of user data, 
                    and therefore we can only process minimal data 
                    about users, only those that are necessary to 
                    maintain the website. Automatically collected 
                    information is used exclusively to identify 
                    potential cases of abuse and establish statistical 
                    data on the use of the website. 
                    These statistical data are not linked in a 
                    way that could identify a specific user of the system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can visit the Website without revealing to us
                     who you are or providing any information that 
                     would identify you as a specific, identifiable 
                     individual. However, if you want to use some 
                     features of the website, receive our newsletter
                      or provide other information via a form, 
                      you may provide us with personal information 
                      such as e-mail, first name, last name, 
                      city of residence, organization and telephone number. 
                      You may choose not to provide us with your personal 
                      information, but then you may not be able to use 
                      certain features of the website. 
                      For example, you will not be able to receive our 
                      newsletter or contact us directly through the website.
                      Users who are not sure which information is 
                      mandatory can contact us via office.universedo@gmail.com.
